# Object-Detection-with-Faster-R-CNN-OSRS-Goblin-Killer-
This repository contains a custom implementation of the Faster R-CNN object detection model tailored for goblin detection in Old School RuneScape (OSRS). I build the model from scratch using TensorFlow, without relying on any pre-trained models.
